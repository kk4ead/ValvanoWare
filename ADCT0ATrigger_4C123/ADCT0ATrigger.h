// This initialization function sets up the ADC according to the
// following parameters.  Any parameters not explicitly listed
// below are not modified:
// Timer0A: enabled
// Mode: 16-bit, down counting
// One-shot or periodic: periodic
// Prescale value: programmable using variable 'prescale' [0:255]
// Interval value: programmable using variable 'period' [0:65535]
// Sample time is busPeriod*(prescale+1)*(period+1)
// Max sample rate: <=125,000 samples/second
// Sequencer 0 priority: 1st (highest)
// Sequencer 1 priority: 2nd
// Sequencer 2 priority: 3rd
// Sequencer 3 priority: 4th (lowest)
// SS3 triggering event: Timer0A
// SS3 1st sample source: programmable using variable 'channelNum' [0:11]
// SS3 interrupts: enabled and promoted to controller
// channelNum must be 0-11 (inclusive) corresponding to Ain0 through Ain11
