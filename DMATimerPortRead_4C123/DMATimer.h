// DMATimer.h
// Runs on LM4F120/TM4C123
// Periodic timer triggered DMA transfer
// Uses Timer5A to trigger the DMA, read from an 8-bit PORT, and then write to a memory Buffer
// There is a Timer5A interrupt after the buffer is full

// ************DMA_Init*****************
// Initialize the Port to memory transfer, triggered by timer 5A
// This needs to be called once before requesting a transfer
// The source address is fixed, destination address incremented each byte
// Inputs:  period in usec
// Outputs: none

// ************DMA_Transfer*****************
// Called to transfer bytes from source to destination
// The source address is fixed, destination address incremented each byte
// Inputs:  source is a pointer to the 32-bit I/O, least significant byte to read
//          destination is a pointer to a place to put the copy
//          count is the number of bytes to transfer (max is 1024 words)
// Outputs: none
// This routine does not wait for completion

// ************DMA_Status*****************
// Can be used to check the status of a previous request
// Inputs:  none
// Outputs: true if still active, false if complete
